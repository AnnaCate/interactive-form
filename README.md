# Interactive Form
This is the 3rd project for the [Treehouse Techdegree](https://join.teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/). 

This project uses JavaScript and jQuery to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional conference called "FullStack Conf." Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, I added my own JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:
* Adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity

* Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.

Instead of plain "vanilla" JavaScript, I used the jQuery library to complete this project.
